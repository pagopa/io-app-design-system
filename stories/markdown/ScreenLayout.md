# Screen templates

The library provides some screen templates that you can use to build your own screen component. These templates do not provide any specific UI guideline to build your screens, but they provide some basic features to help the development of your screen components.

This is a list of the available screen templates:
* `GradientScrollView`: A template component which wraps up a ScrollView with a sticky footer and a gradient background.

* `ForceScrollDownView`: A template component which wraps up a ScrollView with a button to force the scroll down.
