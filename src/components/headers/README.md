# Headers

There are different variants of header components that can be integrated into your screens:
* `HeaderFirstLevel` for the main sections
* `HeaderSecondLevel` for the secondary screens
* `ModalBSHeader`: for modals and/or bottom sheets. The title is usually placed on the left side, while the close button is on the right.

These headers have been developed to work properly alongside the [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) library.

The adoption of these headers has been documented on a [specific documentation page](https://pagopa.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IP/pages/805634170/Come+integrare+l+header+nelle+pagine+di+secondo+livello) (_disclaimer:_ for internal use only).
