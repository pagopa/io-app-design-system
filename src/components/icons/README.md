# Icons
There are different sets:
* **General** 
* **Navigation**: Icons used in the main Tab bar
* **Biometric**: Icons used for the biometric identification
* **Categories**: Icons used for the different sectors available in the Carta Giovani Nazionale
* **Product**: PagoPA products' icons
* **System**: OS-specific icons (iOS/Android)

## Add a new icon

### Prerequisites

In your user interface design app (Figma/Sketch) export your SVG with `1×` preset. The name usually consists of a specific prefix followed by the associated key:
  - **General**: `Icon…`
  - **Navigation**: `IconNav…`
  - **Biometric**: `IconBiometric…`
  - **Categories**: `IconCateg…`
  - **Product**: `IconProduct…`
  - **System**: `IconSystem…`

> [!important]
> The icon must be contained within a `24×24` frame.

> [!tip]
> If you want to add a new `Wallet` icon to be used in the main tab bar, your icon will have a `IconNavWallet` filename. If it doesn't belong to a specific set, you just put the name after the prefix `Icon…`, so `IconWallet`

> [!caution]
> This filename will be the same as the React component, so make sure you don't already have a component with that filename

### Create the corresponding React component

#### Using `generateNewIcons.js`
1. Move the exported file to the `icons/svg/originals` folder
2. In your terminal, in the same folder, run the command: `node generateNewIcons.js`
3. The script will process `timestamp.txt`, generate the new React components (with `*.tsx` extension) following exactly the steps listed in the manual process (see below), and process **only the files added after this timestamp value**
4. If the `generateNewIcons` script accidentally overwrites older React components, remember to discard the changes before committing

> [!caution] 
> If your icon **is not** monochromatic, you should use the manual process because the script doesn't support this specific case yet

#### Manual process (alternative)

1. Move the exported file to the `icons/svg/originals` folder
2. In your original SVG file, delete `width` and `height` attributes and leave the original `viewBox` attribute. You could easily process the image using online editors like [SVGOmg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) (enable `Prefer viewBox to width/height`)
3. In the `icons/svg` folder, create a new React component (with a `.tsx` extension) of the same name
4. Copy all the `<path>` elements into the new React component and replace the original `<path>` with the element `<Path>` (capital P) from the `react-native-svg` package. Replace all the harcoded fill values with the generic `currentColor` value, so that the icon inherits the color from the parent `Svg` container

5. Add the dynamic size and colour (if required), replacing the hardcoded values with the corresponding props. The final result should be similar to the following:
    ```tsx
    import { Svg, Path } from "react-native-svg";
    // [...]

    const IconSpid = ({ size, style }: SVGIconProps) => (
      <Svg width={size} height={size} viewBox="0 0 24 24" style={style}>
        <Path
          d="M13.615 …"
          fill="currentColor"
        />
      </Svg>
    );
    ```
6. Repeat the previous steps for each icon
7. Once you have finished processing all the new icons, run `node generateNewTimestamp` to avoid overwriting these files with the `generateNewIcons` process.

> [!caution] 
> The `currentColor` value should only be added for monochromatic icons. For example, if you export an `IconSystem...` with specific color values, don't add it at all.

### Add the corresponding key to the `Icon` component

Add the desired key to the `IOIcons` object with the corresponding component reference:
```tsx
export const IOIcons = {
  spid: IconSpid,
  …
}
```
> [!important]
> To keep the icons grouped by sets, remember to put the key above the icons with a specific prefix

If the icon belongs to a specific set, add the key to the relative icon set as well:
```tsx
export const IONavIcons = {
  navMessages,
  navWallet,
  navDocuments,
  navServices,
  navProfile,
  // New icon
  navNewIcon
} as const;
```

### Use the new icon in a different component

You can add the recently added icon with the following declaration:
```jsx
// Default size: 24×24px
// Default color: Bluegrey
<Icon name="spid">
```

## View all the available icons
There are two ways:
- In the main app, go to the `Profile → Design System → Icons` (you must enable `Debug Mode`)
- In the repository, go to the `svg/originals` subfolder
