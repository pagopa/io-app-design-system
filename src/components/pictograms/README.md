# Pictograms
There are different sets:
* **General** 
* **Objects**: Pictograms that represent object without hands
* **Bleed**: Pictograms used near the edge of the component's block (w/o inner margins)

## Add a new pictogram

### Prerequisites

In your user interface design app (Figma/Sketch) export your SVG with `1×` preset. The name usually consists of a specific prefix followed by the associated key:
  - **General**: `Pictogram…`
  - **Objects**: `PictogramObj…`
  - **Bleed**: `PictogramBleed…`

> [!important]
> The pictogram must be contained within a `240×240` frame.

> [!tip]
> If you want to add a new `key` object pictogram, your pictogram will have a `PictogramObjKey` filename. If it doesn't belong to a specific set, you just put the name after the prefix `Pictogram…`, so `PictogramKey`

> [!caution]
> This filename will be the same as the React component, so make sure you don't already have a component with that filename

### Create the corresponding React component

#### Using `generateNewPictograms.js`
1. Move the exported file to the `pictograms/svg/originals` folder
2. In your terminal, in the same folder, run the command: `node generateNewPictograms.js`
3. The script will process `timestamp.txt`, generate the new React components (with `*.tsx` extension) following exactly the steps listed in the manual process (see below), and process **only the files added after this timestamp value**
4. If the `generateNewPictograms` script accidentally overwrites older React components, remember to discard the changes before committing

> [!caution] 
> If your pictogram **contains** other shapes than `path`, you should use the manual process because the script doesn't support this specific case yet (e.g: `Circle`)

#### Manual process (alternative)

1. Move the exported file to the `pictograms/svg/originals` folder
2. In your original SVG file, delete `width` and `height` attributes and leave the original `viewBox` attribute. You could easily process the image using online editors like [SVGOmg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) (enable `Prefer viewBox to width/height`)
3. In the `pictograms/svg` folder, create a new React component (with a `.tsx` extension) of the same name
4. Copy all the `<path>` elements into a new React component and replace the original `<path>` with the element `<Path>` (capital P) from the `react-native-svg` package. Replace all the harcoded fill values with the following corresponding values:
    * `#0B3EE3` → `{colorValues.hands}`
    * `#AAEEEF` → `{colorValues.main}`
    * `#00C5CA` → `{colorValues.secondary}`
5. Add the dynamic size, replacing the hardcoded values with the corresponding props. The final result should be similar to the following:

    ```tsx
    import { Svg, Path } from "react-native-svg";
    // [...]

    const PictogramAttention = ({
      size,
      colorValues,
      ...props
    }: SVGPictogramProps) => (
    <Svg width={size} height={size} viewBox="0 0 240 240" {...props}>
      <Path
        d="m137.89 157.04…"
        fill={colorValues.main}
      />
      <Path
        d="M139.17 211.6…"
        fill={colorValues.hands}
      />
    </Svg>
    );
    ```
6. Repeat the previous steps for each pictogram
7. Once you have finished processing all the new pictograms, run `node generateNewTimestamp` to avoid overwriting these files with the `generateNewPictograms` process.

#### Wrong pictogram rendering?
Before exporting the SVG file:
1. Detach the symbol instance to avoid destructive actions to the original source component. Use a draft or disposable project document. **Don't detach it** if you are in the original Design System project file
2. Outline all the present strokes (unless required for dynamic stroke width, but we don't manage this case at the moment)
3. Select all the different paths and flatten into one. Now you should have a single vector layer.
4. Make sure your vector path is centered (both vertically and horizontally) in a square

### Add the corresponding key to the `Pictogram` component

Add the desired key to the `IOPictograms` object with the corresponding component reference:
```jsx
export const IOPictograms = {
  feedback: PictogramFeedback,
  …
}
```
There's no need to add the new pictogram in the specific Design System page because it happens automatically.

> [!important]
> To keep the pictograms grouped by sets, remember to put the key above the pictograms with a specific prefix

If the pictogram belongs to a specific set, add the key to the relative pictogram set as well:
```tsx
// Destructuring starting from `IOPictograms`
const { NEW_PICTOGRAM, ibanCard, manual, trash, clock, key, flyingMessage } =
  IOPictograms;

// Add the new key to the associated object
export const IOPictogramsObject = {
  NEW_PICTOGRAM, // ←
  ibanCard,
  followMessage,
  manual,
  trash,
  clock,
  key,
  flyingMessage
} as const;
```
### Use the new icon in a different component

You can add the recently added pictogram with the following declaration:
```jsx
// Default size: 120×120
<Pictogram name="feedback">
```

## View all the available pictograms
There are two ways:
- In the app, go to the `Profile → Design System → Pictograms` (you must enable `Debug Mode`)
- In the repository, go to the `svg/originals` subfolder
